  Intentionally blank.
  Ignore or build out a view and insert <sd-toolbar></sd-toolbar> in a {N} view to use.
  A file must at least exist since ToolbarComponent is declared in the SampleModule.
  This serves as proof that you don't have to use *all* your web components in {N}.
  As long as a .tns.html file exists for the component, it will build successfully
  even if it is not used.
